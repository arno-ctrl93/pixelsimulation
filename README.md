           Version 1
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Implementation of three class : Board, Agent, Destination
Gestion of Exception with the input "How many squares" (just number are accepted)
Really basic collision between different square (agent)
We can choose with the interface two parameters (speed of agent and the number)
After a collision, squares change color.
This first version is very simply because i just want to remember all the posibility of Unity and C#.
But I want to develop for the next version the class Agent and after start to implement more sophisticated behaviors.
You can also switch Camera with "p".
